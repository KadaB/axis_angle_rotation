Some notes on axis angle rotation

The approach is to first show how you can rotate a vector v in 2D vector arithmetic and then rearrange it into a matrix.

And then how to rotate a 3D vector with vector arithmetic and then rearrange over to a 3D rotation matrix (which rotates a vector v around an given axis).

The tex file is written with pytex so it's a bit annoying to compile. That is why I added the pdf and rendered a png in the readme:
